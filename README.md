# Fyanc Admin Panel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.13.
The project will implement the NG-Zorro UI library to create a basic administration panel.

#cloning the project
to clone the project, go into the terminal in any folder then type git clone https://github.com/Jxxx-Vx/Admin-Panel-v1/

## Development server
In addition, make sure to run the command after cloning: npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

#Checking all dependencies
Go to the package.json to find all the dependacies 

#download angular
type this in the terminal npm install -g @angular/cli

On windows remember to add to path
Without downloading angular into your computer, the project will not run

All the source code is in the src folder. All the other folders are dependencies that are necessary for the program to work

#backend
remember to also run the backend. Many features will not work if the backend is not running in the background. Also remember that the backend is running on localhost:3012 for it to work. Conversely, the back end will only work on port http://localhost:4200/


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
